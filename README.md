# Cubik's
### Cubik's is a 3 x 3 x 3 Rubik's cube simulator and solver for android. <br><br>
User can play with 3D model of rubik's cube and solve their own cube by filling the colors as well. The app solved any scrambled cube under a second using two methods, **CFOP(Fridrich)** and **Kociemba's two-phase method.**<br>
* CFOP method is used by most of the speedcuber. It's a layer by layer method having 4 main steps - Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL. Average length of this solution is 70 moves.<br>
* Two-phase method is developed by Herbert Kociemba. Average length of this solution is 21 moves.<br>
The app also guides the user to the solution step by step by performing every step is simulator. App has other useful settings as well. (Screenshots below).<br><br>
